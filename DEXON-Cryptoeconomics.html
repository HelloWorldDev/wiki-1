While we intend to attempt to realize this vision, please recognize that it is dependent on a number of factors and subject to a wide range of risks. We do not guarantee, represent or warrant any of the statements in this document, because they are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, about which there can be no assurance due to various anticipated and unanticipated events that may occur. Please know that we seek to achieve the vision laid out in our whitepaper and website, but that you cannot rely on any of it coming true. Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, other aspects of our technology and these markets are in their infancy and will be subject to many challenges, competition and a changing environment.</p>
<a class="header" href="#token-allocation" id="token-allocation"><h2>Token Allocation</h2></a>
<p>The total supply of DXN tokens is fixed at <strong>4 billion</strong>. The genesis token supply is <strong>1 billion</strong> DXN and the other <strong>3 billion</strong> DXN will be minted as mining rewards after DEXON mainnet launches. The token allocation is shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/758a1nE.png" width="500">
  <br></br>
  <b> Figure 1. Token Allocation </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>75% for Miner’s Reward</p>
<p>For rewarding miners that actively participate in network consensus and smart contract
executions on DEXON Network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25% for Genesis Supply</p>
<p>The genesis supply will be distributed to 4 parties, including DEXON Foundation / Team and<br />
private sale token purchasers under different vesting schedules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#mining-model" id="mining-model"><h2>Mining Model</h2></a>
<p>Nodes that actively participate in validating transactions will get DXN tokens as mining rewards based on DEXON’s Proof of Participation Model.</p>
<a class="header" href="#proof-of-participation-model" id="proof-of-participation-model"><h3>Proof-of-Participation Model</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>Validator Eligibility</li>
</ul>
<p>A node is eligible to join as a validator if its DXN token deposit reaches the threshold of 1 million DXN. The deposit can come from the node itself or from any other accounts that support the node. It takes 24 hours for the deposit to become effective, and another 24 hours for deposit withdrawals to become effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetric Validator Power</li>
</ul>
<p>The validating power and the probability to be selected as a block producer among all validators are both fair and symmetric, meaning that the expected mining rewards of each validator will be the same as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mining Rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>A validator earns transaction processing fees, gas fees, and mining rewards when it actively produces blocks and acks to other blocks.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adaptive-mining-mechanism" id="adaptive-mining-mechanism"><h2>Adaptive Mining Mechanism</h2></a>
<p>DEXON adopts a novel adaptive mining mechanism that can self-adjust the token minting velocity. The token minting velocity is proportional to the participation rate of mining. If the demand of DXN token is strong, it will attract more token holders to participate in mining for rewards, hence the minting velocity will increase, and vice versa. This will make sure the system can keep demand and supply balanced by itself.</p>
<p>The formula of minting velocity is stated below:</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/4gMwxZo.png" width="400">
</p>
r is total supply growth rate (the annual growth rate of total supply), vis node mining velocity (the annual mining rate of each node), and  is mining participation rate (the percentage of deposited tokens in validators relative to current total token circulation). 
Initially, v is 18.75% and will alter based on the total minted tokens under a half-life condition. 
The relation between node mining velocity and minted tokens is shown below:
<ul>
<li>
<p>v= 18.75% when mainnet launches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v= 9.375% after 1.5 billion DXN tokens are minted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v= 4.6875% after another 750 million DXN tokens are minted,  and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, inniitialy each node can mine 1M * 18.75% = 187.5K DXN tokens per year. As total minted tokens hit 1. 5B DXN, the annual mining rate per node will decrease from 18.75% to 9.375%, and as total minted tokens hit 2. 25B DXN, the annual per node mining rate will decrease further from 9.375% to 4.6875%, and so on.</p>

</p>
<a class="header" href="#mining-rewards-in-circulation" id="mining-rewards-in-circulation"><h2>Mining Rewards in Circulation</h2></a>
<p>Now, let’s consider the influence of mining participation rate. For example, the genesis supply of DXN token is 1 billion, if 500 millions tokens are deposited in validating nodes, the mining participation rate will be 50%. So the total supply growth rate will be 18.75% * 50% = 9.375%.
The total mining rewards in circulation based on different participation rates (30%, 50%, 70%) is shown in the figure below:</p>

## Genesis Allocation
As stated above, the genesis supply is 1 billion DXN and the allocation is shown below:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/XhtJBjk.png" width="600">
  <br></br>
  <b> Figure 5. Genesis Supply Allocation </b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>38.5% to Private Sale Purchasers (Genesis allocation, under 1-year vesting)
For building strategic partnerships with influential industry entities and growing the
DApps ecosystem.</li>
<li>1.5 % to Public Sale Purchasers (Genesis allocation, no lock-up condition)
For distributing tokens to early developers / users.</li>
<li>40% to DEXON Foundation (Genesis allocation, under 4-year vesting)
For long-term network development funding and governance, advisory, airdrops, etc.</li>
<li>20% to Founding team (Genesis allocation, under 4-year vesting)
For incentivising the founding team members and core developers.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#private-sale-385" id="private-sale-385"><h3>Private Sale (38.5%)</h3></a>
<p>DEXON Foundation only allows world-famous VC firms, crypto funds, and DEXON DApps ecosystem partners to participate in the private sale. The goal of the private sale is to build up partnership relationships and grow the DEXON DApps ecosystem.
According to the purchased amount, a private sale purchaser will be granted an additional bonus of DXN tokens as shown in the figure below. Note that the bonus structure is tier-based and cumulative.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/wK3gFAe.png" width="600">
  <br></br>
  <b> Figure 6. Private Sale Purchaser Additional Bonus </b>
</p>
<p>DXN tokens sold in private sale will be under a 1-year lock-up condition. 3 months after mainnet launches, 10% of DXN tokens will be vested, while each month thereafter, an additional 10% of DEX tokens will be vested in the following 10 months. The bonus portion will be vested 12 months after mainnet launch.</p>
<p>The vesting schedule is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd - 12th month after mainnet launch: 10%</li>
<li>13th month after mainnet launch: bonus portion</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if one purchases 10M USD for 100M DXN tokens, his bonus will be as presented below:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2M tier: 5% bonus, 0.5M DXN tokens</li>
<li>2-3M tier: 10% bonus, 1M DXN tokens</li>
<li>3-4M tier: 15% bonus, 1.5M DXN tokens</li>
<li>4-5M tier: 20% bonus, 2M DXN tokens</li>
<li>5M+ tier: 25% bonus, 12.5M DXN tokens
In total, the purchaser will get additional 17.5M DXN tokens as bonus. The vesting schedule would be as shown below:</li>

<p>DEXON Foundation will sell DXN tokens to the public. The goal of public sale is to distribute tokens to early developers and users. The price of each DXN token in the public sale will be 0.2 USD.
All DXN tokens sold in public sale will be vested when mainnet launches.</p>
<a class="header" href="#dexon-foundation-reserved-40" id="dexon-foundation-reserved-40"><h3>DEXON Foundation Reserved (40%)</h3></a>
<p>DEXON Foundation reserves DXN tokens for long-term network development funding and governance, advisory, airdrop and more. Most of the vested DXN tokens will be distributed to the public in the long run to ensure long-term network decentralization.
DEXON Foundation’s reserved tokens are under a 4-year vesting schedule. When the mainnet launches, 20% of DXN tokens will be vested, while each year thereafter, an additional 20% of DXN tokens will be vested. The vesting schedule is shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainnet launch: 20%</li>
<li>1st to 4th year after mainnet launch: 20%</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#dexon-founding-team-reserved-20" id="dexon-founding-team-reserved-20"><h3>DEXON Founding Team Reserved (20%)</h3></a>
<p>DEXON founding team reserved DXN tokens are to incentivize the founding team members and core developers. These tokens are under a 4-year vesting schedule. When the mainnet launches, 20% of the tokens will be vested, while each year thereafter, an additional 20% of DXN tokens will be vested. The vesting schedule is shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainnet launch: 20%</li>
<li>1st to 4th year after mainnet launch: 20%</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#token-circulation" id="token-circulation"><h2>Token Circulation</h2></a>
<p>The total DXN tokens in circulation will gradually increase as mining rewards are minted and the initial token holder’s tokens are vested.</p>
<ol>
<li>75% to DEXON Miners (Mining rewards, responsive half-life condition)</li>
<li>25% for Genesis Supply</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>38.5% to Private Sale Purchasers (Genesis allocation, under 1-year vesting)</li>
<li>1.5% to Public Sale Purchasers (Genesis allocation, no lock-up condition)</li>
<li>40% to DEXON Foundation (Genesis allocation, 4-year vesting)</li>
<li>20% to Founding team (Genesis allocation, under 4-year vesting)
Assuming the mining participation rate is fixed at 50%, 30 years after mainnet launch, about 98.8% (3,953,284,807 / 4,000,000,000) of DXN tokens will be in  public circulation. The long-term total token circulation chart is shown below:</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Technology - Sophistication.
Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language; a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science is required in order to appreciate inherent risks.  You represent and warrant that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, experience, and/or professional advice sufficient to undertake a prudent evaluation of the merits and risks of purchasing the DXN Tokens. You agree to bear sole responsibility for the aforementioned purchase.</p>

<p>Technology - No guarantee.
Neither DEXON Foundation nor its affiliates owns or controls any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. Neither DEXON Foundation nor its affiliates makes any guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology - Forks.
The blockchain technology underlying tokens is subject to change at any time, including changes in operating rules (commonly referred to as “forks”), and blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, hard forks, or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. Such changes may materially and adversely affect the value or function of the DXN Tokens. You agree that you are fully responsible for monitoring such changes and agree to bear all risks arising therefrom or relating thereto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology - Malicious Nodes.
Some nodes in the DEXON Foundation network may be malicious and attempt to get rewarded without corresponding contribution; also, attackers may try to ruin the DEXON Foundation ecosystem if they only suffer from minimal penalties. We need strong guarantees to protect the network from malicious attacks to ensure that the transactions are secured and the ecosystem is sustainable. Some attacks that could threaten a blockchain network are listed and discussed as follows:
Sybil Attack
Malicious nodes could create multiple Sybil identities to strive for more rewards or cheat the network. In general, the proof mechanism should have established barriers to prevent Sybil attacks; however, there is no guarantee such barriers will always be successful.
Out-of- Work Attack
While an attacker can control a lot of nodes, the nodes could be used to make some troubles on a distributed computing network. The nodes controlled by malicious attackers could be called zombies. An attack methodology is to ask the zombie nodes to quit or go on a strike at one time. On DEXON Foundation network, the zombie nodes may take AI jobs but fail to complete them or return invalid results. If an AI job is assigned to a group of which most are zombie nodes, the AI job would receive unauthentic results or just simply fail.
Outsourcing Attack
Malicious nodes may outsource their jobs to other nodes, such that they may earn the rewards easily without consuming the corresponding computing power. On DEXON Foundation network, nodes should present their capabilities to strive for taking jobs. Validation of node capabilities based on Proof-of-Intelligence may mitigate the behavior of outsourcing attack because the malicious nodes would lose their jobs if they do not endeavor to execute the same; however, there is no guarantee this approach will always be successful.
Cyber-attacks
In the event of a cyberattack on the DXN Tokens or the DEXON Foundation, the DXN Tokens may be adversely affected. Neither DEXON Foundation nor its affiliates makes any guarantee that it may foresee, prevent, mitigate, or take corrective action in the event of such attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory Measures
Crypto-tokens are being, or may be overseen by the regulatory authorities of various jurisdictions. DEXON Foundation may receive queries, notices, warnings, requests, or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from time to time or may even be ordered to suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the DXN Tokens. The development of the DXN Tokens may be seriously affected, hindered, or terminated as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illiquidity and Price Volatility
There may not be a demand for DXN Tokens. DEXON Foundation is not responsible for the circulation and trading of DXN Tokens on the market. Tokens, if traded on markets, usually have extremely volatile prices. Fluctuations in price over short periods of time frequently occur, which price may be denominated in Bitcoin, Ether, US Dollars or any other fiat currency. Such fluctuations could result from market forces (including speculations), regulatory changes, technical innovations, availability of exchanges, and other objective factors and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand.
DEXON Foundation does not make any representation or warranty, explicit or implicit, as to the usability or the value of the DXN Tokens. You understand and accept that there is no warranty or assurance that you will receive any benefits through the DXN Tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance by Users.
You acknowledge and agree that DEXON Foundation is not responsible for determining whether or which laws, rules, or regulations apply or may apply to your transactions (including, without limitation, any anti-money laundering laws, securities laws and tax laws). You acknowledge and agree that you are in compliance with all such laws, rules, or regulations as may be applicable to your transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all tax obligations arising from your purchase of the DXN Tokens.
